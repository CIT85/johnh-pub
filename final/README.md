# H1 My Topic
I am choosing to build a webpage covering the development of an NFL team, the San Francisco 49ers. I have grown up watching the SF 49ers and have been a die-hard fan for decades. I remember growing up watching the team with my dad and I continue on the same tradition with my children. The team means a lot to my family and I and I can't wait to share the early years of the team, the peak of team success in the 80's and 90's, to most recent years and expectations for this year. I'll be using ChatGPT to assist with content and using prompts like 'the development of the San Francisco 49ers', 'key parts of the team successs in the 80's and 90's', and using self scouting report on expecations this year.

# H1 P3 Mid-Review
**Wow** What a semester! I am super proud of myself with how fare I have come as a student with the challenges that I have seen this semester. I am excited to share with you that I will be pursuing a Computer Science degree and know I have a long journey ahead of me. Here are some things I'm most excited about:
1. Adjusting the format and color and being able to fit it into the header by cropping and re adjusting size
2. My use of flex and grid, even though I could've gone a little deeper
3. I'm still trying to get a little more complex with the media queries
4. I've gotten so much more comfortable with code in the past day and can't wait to continue to grow!
