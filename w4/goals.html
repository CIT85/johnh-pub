    <dd><strong>Academically & Personally</strong></dd>
    <p><dd>I am returning after a 12 year gap in college. As I was younger m</dd> life was pretty busy and wasn't able to prioritize school with what I had going on. Now I have 3 children and I don't want any excuses on why they cant attend college. I am looking to further my skills to help me accomplish personal goals that I have set out.
